PROJECT:RULE-BASED CHATBOT


# üéì Rule-Based College Chatbot

This project, titled "Build a Rule-Based Chatbot", is a Python-based chatbot designed to simulate basic human-like interactions using predefined responses. It is intended to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to a college setting. The chatbot works by identifying keywords in the user‚Äôs input and responding with relevant, hardcoded answers. Unlike AI-powered bots, this chatbot uses a simple rule-based approach, making it lightweight, beginner-friendly, and easy to understand. Its purpose is to demonstrate how conversational logic can be implemented without the use of machine learning or external APIs.

## üìå Features

- Answers common college FAQs such as:
  - Admission criteria
  - Campus location
  - Courses offered
  - Fee structure
  - Contact details
- Uses basic string matching to detect keywords in user queries.
- Runs in a terminal/command-line interface (CLI).
- Lightweight and easy to modify or extend.
